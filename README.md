# colorku
Color sudoku puzzle sample

### About this project
Colorku is a simple color-based sudoku puzzle, built with jQuery, qTip2, and Sass/Compass.
Future improvements include adding a puzzle generator (as this is currently only a single puzzle) and replacing the success/failure alerts with a stylized modal.
